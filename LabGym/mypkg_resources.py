    (from Google AI Overview)
    pkg_resources.resource_filename() is a function from the
    pkg_resources module (part of setuptools) in Python. It is used to
    obtain the true filesystem path for a specified resource within a
    Python package.

    Purpose:
    This function is particularly useful when you need to access files
    within a package as actual files on the filesystem, rather than just
    as strings or streams. This is often necessary for tasks like
    loading configuration files, image assets, or other data files that
    external libraries or tools might expect to find at a specific file
    path.

    How it works:
    Package Resources: pkg_resources.resource_filename() takes two main
    arguments:
    *   package_or_requirement: The name of the package (e.g., 
        'my_package') or a Requirement object.
    *   resource_name: The path to the resource within that package 
        (e.g., 'data/config.ini', 'images/icon.png').

    Extraction (if needed): If the package is distributed in an archive
    format (like a zipped .egg file), resource_filename() will extract
    the requested resource (and potentially other related resources) to
    a temporary cache directory and return the path to that extracted
    file.

    Direct Path (if available): If the package is installed directly
    on the filesystem (e.g., as a directory), it will return the
    direct path to the resource within that directory.
