# The .coveragerc file is a configuration file used by coverage.py, a
# tool for measuring code coverage in Python projects. This file allows
# users to customize various aspects of how coverage.py operates,
# including which files to include or exclude from coverage reports, how
# to handle specific lines of code, and the format of the output
# reports.
#
# Key aspects of a .coveragerc file: 
#   Purpose: It provides a centralized way to configure coverage.py
#   settings, making it easier to maintain consistent coverage
#   measurement across multiple test runs and environments.
#   
#   Location and Naming: The default name for the configuration file is
#   .coveragerc, and it should be placed in the same directory where
#   coverage.py is being run. Alternatively, a different file and
#   location can be specified using the --rcfile command-line option or
#   the COVERAGE_RCFILE environment variable.
#   
#   Content: The file uses an INI-style format with sections like [run],
#   [report], [html], and [json], each containing specific options
#   related to different stages of the coverage process.
